A secure, open-source browser extension wallet for AVM chains

Unfinished. Based on React monorepo.

Feel free to do with it whatever you'd like.

Things TBD in order to make it fully functional:

- asset send page (finish interface)
- opt in page (finish interface)
- settings page (finish interface + configuration) - node configuration mainly
- rekey page + including rekey logic into app
- sdk for external apps

All in all, it shouldn't take more than a couple weeks. Good luck!
