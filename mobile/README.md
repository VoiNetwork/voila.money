### THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED TO FIT - copied from a react native monorepo

To convert a React (web) build folder into a mobile application available on app stores, you can use a WebView-based approach. WebView is a native component that renders web content, allowing you to package your web application inside a mobile app. You can create separate mobile projects for Android and iOS using WebView.

For Android, you can use Android Studio, and for iOS, you can use Xcode. Here's a general outline of the process for both platforms:

Android

Install Android Studio, if you haven't already, and create a new Android project.

In your project's res/layout folder, open the activity_main.xml file and replace its content with the following XML to add a WebView component:

    xml
    Copy code
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <WebView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
        android:id="@+id/webview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        tools:context=".MainActivity" />
    In the MainActivity.java file, add the following code to load your React build folder into the WebView:
    java
    Copy code
    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.webkit.WebView;
    import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
    
    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    
        private WebView webView;
    
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    
            webView = findViewById(R.id.webview);
            webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
            webView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html");
        }
    }
Copy your React build folder into the android/app/src/main/assets folder of your Android project and rename it to www.

Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

After testing and making any necessary adjustments, generate a signed APK or Android App Bundle and submit it to the Google Play Store.

iOS

Install Xcode, if you haven't already, and create a new iOS project.

In your project's Main.storyboard, add a WebView (WKWebView) component to the ViewController and create an outlet for it in the ViewController.swift file.

In the ViewController.swift file, add the following code to load your React build folder into the WebView:
    
    swift
    Copy code
    import UIKit
    import WebKit
    
    class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
        @IBOutlet weak var webView: WKWebView!
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            
            if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "index", withExtension: "html", subdirectory: "www") {
                webView.loadFileURL(url, allowingReadAccessTo: url.deletingLastPathComponent())
            }
        }
    }
In the Xcode project, create a new folder called www inside the project directory (not inside the Assets.xcassets folder) and copy the contents of your React build folder into it.

In Xcode, go to your project settings and make sure the www folder is added to the "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase.

Build and run the app on an iOS device or simulator.

After testing and making any necessary adjustments, archive the app and submit it to the App Store.

Please note that WebView-based applications may not provide the same performance and user experience as native apps. Also, WebView apps might face stricter app store review processes, so it's essential to ensure your app complies with the respective platform's guidelines.


Will this work for any other build import? Let's say I have manifest.json or index.css files. If I import the index.html file, will it properly resolve?
Yes, if you import the index.html file and have properly referenced the manifest.json, index.css, and other asset files, the WebView should resolve and load them correctly. The WebView will behave as a browser rendering the HTML content, which includes loading linked CSS, JavaScript, and other resources.

For Android, make sure you copy all your assets (including the manifest.json and index.css files) to the www folder inside the android/app/src/main/assets directory. WebView will then resolve the relative paths and load those files as needed.

For iOS, make sure you have added all the required files (including the manifest.json and index.css files) to the www folder inside the Xcode project directory. Ensure that these files are also added to the "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase.

However, note that certain features in the manifest.json file, such as the web app's appearance and behavior when installed on a device, might not work as expected in a WebView-based app. This is because the WebView acts as an isolated web rendering engine and doesn't have the same context as a standalone web app installed on a device.

Nonetheless, the WebView should properly resolve and load the index.css file and other linked assets in your index.html.
